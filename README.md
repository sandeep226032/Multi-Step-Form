# Multi-Step-Form
In this project, I developed a multi-step form using React.js to enhance user experience by breaking down complex forms into manageable steps. The form guides users through a sequence of three stages, each capturing specific information, ensuring a smooth and intuitive data entry process.
Feautres 
1. tabbed navigation for applying I used react router dom
2. client-side validation I used useState hooks and regex expression form email,name contain only alphabets and it is only done in first step and third step at perview stage user can read data beacuse of readonly property

 
3.for making responsive I used media querry.


4	Retrieve and pre-fill form fields if the user revisits the form. for this i used local storage and useEffect hooks of react js
